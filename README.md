# mac-dotfiles

## Introduction

My mac dotfiles, with an environment bootstrap. 

Install via 

```
./install.sh
```

Update via 

```
./update.sh
```

## Requirements

* MacOS / zsh
* Homebrew


## Things of Note

* gitconfig (mostly aliases, some other settings)
* Brewfile (some software I want to have installed everywhere)
* python-requirements.txt (python packages I want to have installed everywhere)
* vimrc (a few vim settings)
* zshrc (some exports and functions)
  * .zsh/aliases (lots of aliases included into zshrc)

## Thanks

...for inspiration and, at times, being on the receiving end of dotfile "theft"...
