# mac-dotfiles

## Introduction

My mac dotfiles, with an environment bootstrap. 

Install via ./install.sh

Update via ./update.sh

## Things of Note

* gitconfig (mostly aliases, some other settings)
* Brewfile (some software I want to have installed everywhere)
* python-requirements.txt (python packages I want to have installed everywhere)
* vimrc (a few vim settings)
* zshrc (lots of aliases, some exports and functions)

## Thanks

...for inspiration and, at times, being on the receiving end of dotfile "theft"...
